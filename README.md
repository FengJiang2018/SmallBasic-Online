# SmallBasic-Online

An open-source IDE/runtime for the Small Basic programming language.

To launch a local instance of the editor:
* Have node/npm installed.
* `npm i` to install the required packages
* `npm run gulp watch-source` to start the webpack server.
* Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
* webpack should print out that url if another one was used.
